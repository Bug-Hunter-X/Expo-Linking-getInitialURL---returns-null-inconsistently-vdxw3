The issue is addressed by adding a delay and retry mechanism, ensuring that `Linking.getInitialURL()` is called multiple times with a small delay in between each attempt to improve the chance of retrieving the URL.

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

async function getInitialURLWithRetry() {
  let url = null;
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    url = await Linking.getInitialURL();
    if (url) {
      break;
    }
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Wait 500ms before retrying
  }
  return url;
}

export default getInitialURLWithRetry;
```
